## This is my Project #1 for CodePath Android Camp

The purpose of this application is to pull the "Now Playing" results from [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and parse the JSON responses to populate a ListView with custom objects. Tapping the custom objects in the listview will allow a user to view an overview of the popular movie, along with the aggregate voted score out of 5 stars.

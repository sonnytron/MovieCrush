## This is my Project #1 for CodePath Android Camp

The purpose of this application is to pull the "Now Playing" results from [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and parse the JSON responses to populate a ListView with custom objects. Tapping the custom objects in the listview will allow a user to view an overview of the popular movie, along with the aggregate voted score out of 5 stars.  
  
# **How many hours did this take to complete?**  
Overall, this project took **about 17 hours** of coding, research, retrospective to complete. I have not factored in the lab and Pod hours that are required for meeting with my remote cohort and instructors.  
  
# **Which required and optional stories have you completed?**  
  
* All required stories have been implemented: Landscape/Portrait, complete movie overview and images, ViewHolder pattern  
* Stretch: Expose details of movie in a separate activity with votes/stars

# Useful frameworks/techniques implemented:  

* AsyncHttpClient  
* JsonResponseHandler  
* RecyclerView  
* Adapter/ViewHolder Pattern
* Interface Callback
